# Kerberos Factory

Kerberos Factory brings the Kerberos Agent to another level. The Kerberos Agent can be deployed anywhere you want, it can run as a binary, Docker container and inside a Kubernetes cluster. The latter is where Kerberos Factory shines, it is a UI that allows you to deploy and configure your Kerberos Agents into your Kubernetes cluster more easily.
